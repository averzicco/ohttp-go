This library contains an implementation of [Oblivious HTTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-thomson-http-oblivious/) and binary representations of HTTP messages ([RFC9292](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9292)). Binary HTTP support is limited to known-length messages. Indeterminate-length messages are not currently supported.

## Security Disclaimer

ðŸš¨ This library is offered as-is, and without a guarantee. Therefore, it is expected that changes in the code, repository, and API occur in the future. We recommend to take caution before using this library in a production application since part of its content is experimental.
